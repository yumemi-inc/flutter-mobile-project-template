## About Icon

Language: English | [日本語](/docs/ja/ABOUT_ICON.md)

### iOS

- For iOS icons, the image size used by the Apple Store is 1024x1024, and for other sizes, [flutter_launcher_icons] can automatically generate smaller ones.
- Therefore, for the icons you need, 1024x1024 is fine; smaller than 1024x1024 is fine, but too small may result in poor quality icons.

### Android

- Adaptive Launcher Icons were introduced in Android 8.0 (API level 26), allowing different shapes to be displayed for each device model.
  - `adaptive_icon_foreground`
    - Logo or icon image
    - The size of the image should be 1024x1024.
    - The size of the icon should be about 0.67 times larger than the size of the image to make it fit better.

  - `adaptive_icon_background`
    - Icon background image
    - A color code or background image is required.
    - As for the size of the image, 1024x1024 is fine.

- The following table includes specific icons. There is a border on the image, but it was added to make it visible; however, the border is not necessary when adding icons.
- For a detailed explanation, please check [adaptive icon guide].
