You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory


=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project flutter-project

=== Hosting:github Setup

i  Detected a .git folder at /path
i  Authorizing with GitHub to upload your service account to a GitHub repository's secrets store.

```

## 4. Change workflow content

Modify `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yaml`.

### 4-1. Remove repository name condition

To avoid inadvertent execution of the workflow when a new project is created based on this template project, we have
included an activation condition by repository name.
This description is no longer needed during setup, so please delete it.
